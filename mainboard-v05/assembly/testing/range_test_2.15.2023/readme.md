# Range Test Notes

- performed over ~50km from the Durand building to Lick observatory
- performed with an untuned (and old, with unknown build quality) antenna from Sapling
- tested at 437.4 mHz with Sapling LoRa parameters (similar for ranging purposes but differentiable from Yearling parameters)
